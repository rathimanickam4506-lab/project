🧩 Project Title: Login Authentication System
📝 Description
The Login Authentication System is a simple web-based application designed to verify user identity before granting access to a website or system.
It allows users to enter a username and password, checks the credentials with stored data, and displays a message indicating whether the login is successful or not.
This system helps maintain security and ensures that only authorized users can access private or restricted areas of an application.

⚙️ How It Works
The user enters their username and password in the login form.

When the Login button is clicked, the system compares the entered data with the predefined valid credentials stored in the program (for demo purpose).

If both username and password match:

A success message “✅ Login Successful!” appears.

If the credentials do not match:

An error message “❌ Invalid Username or Password!” is shown.

The output is displayed at the center of the screen with colorful, large-sized text for better user experience.
